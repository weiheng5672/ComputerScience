### 重新整理後的原文

Another basic data structure is a list, which is a collection whose entries are arranged sequentially (Figure 8.1a). The beginning of a list is called the head of the list. The other end of a list is called the tail. Almost any collection of data can be envisioned as a list. For example, text can be envisioned as a list of symbols, a two-dimensional array can be envisioned as a list of rows, and music recorded on a CD can be envisioned as a list of sounds. More traditional examples include guest lists, shopping lists, class enrollment lists, and inventory lists. Activities associated with a list vary depending on the situation. In some cases, we may need to remove entries from a list, add new entries to a list, “process” the entries in a list one at a time, change the arrangement of the entries in a list, or perhaps search to see if a particular item is in a list. We will investigate such operations later in this chapter.

By restricting the manner in which the entries of a list are accessed, we obtain two special types of lists known as stacks and queues. A stack is a list in which entries are inserted and removed only at the head. An example is a stack of books where physical restrictions dictate that all additions and deletions occur at the top (Figure 8.1b). Following colloquial terminology, the head of a stack is called the top of the stack. The tail of a stack is called its bottom or base. Inserting a new entry at the top of a stack is called pushing an entry. Removing an entry from the top of a stack is called popping an entry. Note that the last entry placed on a stack will always be the first entry removed—an observation that leads to a stack being known as a last-in, first-out, or LIFO (pronounced “LIE-foe”) structure. This LIFO characteristic means that a stack is ideal for storing items that must be retrieved in the reverse order from which they were stored, and thus a stack is often used as the underpinning of backtracking activities. (The term backtracking refers to the process of backing out of a system in the opposite order from which the system was entered. A classic example is the process of retracing one’s steps in order to find one’s way out of a forest.) For instance, consider the underlying structure required to support a recursive process. As each new activation is started, the previous activation must be set aside. Moreover, as each activation is completed, the last activation that was set aside must be retrieved. Thus, if the activations are pushed on a stack as they are set aside, then the proper activation will be on the top of the stack each time an activation needs to be retrieved.

A queue is a list in which the entries are removed only at the head and new entries are inserted only at the tail. An example is a line, or queue, of people waiting to buy tickets at a theater (Figure 8.1c)—the person at the head of the queue is served while new arrivals step to the rear (or tail) of the queue. We have already met the queue structure in Chapter 3, where we saw that a batch processing operating system stores the jobs waiting to be executed in a queue called the job queue. There we also learned that a queue is a first-in, first-out, or FIFO (pronounced “FIE-foe”) structure, meaning that the entries are removed from a queue in the order in which they were stored. Queues are often used as the underlying structure of a buffer, introduced in Chapter 1, which is a storage area for the temporary placement of data being transferred from one location to another. As the items of data arrive at the buffer, they are placed at the tail of the queue. Then, when it comes time to forward items to their final destination, they are forwarded in the order in which they appear at the head of the queue. Thus, items are forwarded in the same order in which they arrived.

### 解釋

這段文字介紹了三種基本的資料結構：**列表（List）**、**堆疊（Stack）**和**佇列（Queue）**，並詳細說明了它們的特性、操作方式以及應用場景。

---

#### 1. **列表（List）**
   - **定義**：列表是一種按順序排列的資料集合，具有一個「頭部」（head）和一個「尾部」（tail）。
   - **特性**：
     - 列表中的資料項可以是任何型別，並且可以動態地增加或刪除。
     - 列表的應用非常廣泛，例如：
       - 文字可以被視為符號的列表。
       - 二維陣列可以被視為行的列表。
       - 音樂 CD 可以被視為聲音的列表。
     - 傳統的例子包括賓客名單、購物清單、班級註冊名單和庫存清單。
   - **操作**：
     - 列表的操作包括：
       - 刪除資料項。
       - 新增資料項。
       - 逐一處理資料項。
       - 重新排列資料項。
       - 搜尋特定資料項。

---

#### 2. **堆疊（Stack）**
   - **定義**：堆疊是一種特殊的列表，其中資料項只能在「頭部」（稱為「頂部」）進行插入和刪除。
   - **特性**：
     - 堆疊的操作遵循「後進先出」（Last-In, First-Out, LIFO）的原則，即最後插入的資料項會最先被移除。
     - 插入資料項稱為「推入」（push），移除資料項稱為「彈出」（pop）。
   - **應用**：
     - 堆疊適合用於需要反向檢索資料的場景，例如：
       - **回溯（Backtracking）**：例如在迷宮中尋找出路時，需要按照進入的相反順序退出。
       - **遞迴（Recursion）**：在遞迴過程中，每次新的函數呼叫會被推入堆疊，完成後再從堆疊中彈出。

---

#### 3. **佇列（Queue）**
   - **定義**：佇列是一種特殊的列表，其中資料項只能從「頭部」移除，並只能在「尾部」插入。
   - **特性**：
     - 佇列的操作遵循「先進先出」（First-In, First-Out, FIFO）的原則，即最先插入的資料項會最先被移除。
   - **應用**：
     - 佇列適合用於需要按順序處理資料的場景，例如：
       - **排隊系統**：例如劇院售票處的排隊。
       - **作業系統的作業佇列（Job Queue）**：用於存儲等待執行的任務。
       - **緩衝區（Buffer）**：用於臨時存儲從一個位置傳輸到另一個位置的資料，確保資料按到達順序被處理。

---

#### 4. **總結**
   - **列表**是一種通用的資料結構，適用於各種需要順序存儲和操作的場景。
   - **堆疊**和**佇列**是列表的兩種特殊形式，分別基於 LIFO 和 FIFO 原則，適用於特定的應用場景。
   - 這些資料結構的設計目的是為了讓程式設計師能夠更高效地組織和操作資料，從而提升程式的可讀性和可維護性。

這段文字通過具體的例子，清晰地解釋了列表、堆疊和佇列的定義、特性以及應用場景，並強調了它們在資料抽象化中的重要性。
